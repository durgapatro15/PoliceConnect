##  Project Description

 **PoliceConnect a Police Grievance Management Portal** is a full-stack Spring Boot web application built to digitize and streamline the process of filing and resolving civic complaints. 

✔️ Citizens can register, log in, and submit complaints with images and location data.  
✔️ Police officers can view and update their assigned cases.  
✔️ Government and officer dashboards provide tools to assign complaints, monitor progress, and improve transparency.

The system supports file uploads, geo-tagging, dynamic views via Thymeleaf, and role-based access control. It’s a modular, extensible solution for improving governance and public service delivery.
